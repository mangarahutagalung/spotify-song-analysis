# spotify-song-analysis
This analysis was created for a school project. The main idea is to analyze how Spotify's music feature works in recommending users to new music. I will create a full walkthrough of this project in the near future. For the time being, if you have any questions regarding the code or any other questions regarding this project, you can shoot me an email at mangara@sas.upenn.edu.

Files Description:
1. SPOTIFY RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM Group 3 - UPDATED: this is my team's final presentation for this project
2. scrape_playlist: a jupyter notebook file that you can use to scrape songs from all playlists that a given username has subscribed to
3. playlist_analysis: a jupyter notebook file for analyzing all the songs from playlists that you have scrapped. In this file, we will learn to cluster people's tastes in music based on Spotify's music feature that you can then use as the base for your music recommendation engine.
