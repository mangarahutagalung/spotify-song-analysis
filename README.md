# spotify-song-analysis
This analysis was created for a school project. The main idea is to analyze how Spotify music feature works in recommending user to new music. I will create a full walkthrough of this project in the near future. For the time being, if you have any questions regarding the code or any other questions regarding this project, you can shoot me an email at mangara@sas.upenn.edu.
