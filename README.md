# spotify-song-analysis
This analysis was created for a school project. The main idea is to analyze how Spotify music feature works in recommending user to new music. I will create a full walkthrough of this project in the near future. For the time being, if you have any questions regarding the code or any other questions regarding this project, you can shoot me an email at mangara@sas.upenn.edu.

1. SPOTIFY RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM Group 3 - UPDATED: this is my team's final presentation for this project
2. scrape_playlist: a jupyter notebook file that you can use to scrape playlist from any given username
3. playlist_analysis: a jupyter notebook file for analyzing all the playlist that you have scrapped. In this file, we will learn to cluster people's taste in music based on Spotify's music feature that you can then use as the base for your music recommendation engine.
